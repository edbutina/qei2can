#qei2can

This project was developed in TI's code composer studio V9.3.
Encoder used is an accucoder 15T-02SA-0500NV1ROC-J04.
Project status: so far, the QEI0 peripheral is configured to read and accumulate position (no index pulse).  This is working correctly.  I have not setup the CAN peripheral yet because I'm waiting on a transceiver to test with.  I plan on hooking my contraption up to a beaglebone black since it has socketcan.
